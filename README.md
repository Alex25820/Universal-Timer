# Universal-Timer
A universal timer for Premiere Pro that can do almost anything.

I decided to make Universal Timer after wanting to add a timer to one of my Premiere Pro projects. After trying many timer templates that I found on the internet I eventually gave up as all the timers I tried seemed to have at least one limitation. Universal Timer is designed to have as few limitations as possible.

## Included features
- Timer Start Position
- Timer Speed
- Custom Spacer (the : in 00:00)
- Show/Hide Hours, Minutes and/or Seconds
- Font Customization (font, style, size)
- Counter mode (Will work as counter instead of timer)
- Position
- Scale
- Rotation
- Opacity
